## Hi, I'm Godwill

I'm a Health Data Science MSc student at the University of Galway, with a background in Operations Research and Statistics. I've worked as a Monitoring & Evaluation Specialist in public health and currently spend my days fitting Bayesian models and wrangling survey data.

### Why this blog?

I've noticed something in the rush toward AI and machine learning: people want to run the algorithms but skip understanding *why* they work. The matrix algebra, the probability theory, the regression foundations, these aren't just academic hurdles. They're the difference between someone who uses tools and someone who understands them.

**Stats Beneath** is my attempt to bridge that gap. Each week, I take one statistical concept and explain it the way I wish it had been explained to me, with real-world analogies, clear visuals, and zero unnecessary jargon.

### My approach

Every article follows a simple structure:

1. **The real-world hook** - why should you care?
2. **The intuition** - what's actually going on, in plain language
3. **The visual** - a plot or diagram that makes it click
4. **The code** (optional) - simple R examples for those who want hands-on practice
5. **The takeaway** - one sentence you'll remember

If you find these useful, share them with someone who thinks statistics is scary. It doesn't have to be.
