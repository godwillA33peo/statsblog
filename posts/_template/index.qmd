## The real-world hook

Did you know?
:::
A surprising, memorable fact related to this week's topic. Keep it to 2-3 sentences.
:::

*Start with a story, analogy, or question that connects this concept to something your reader already understands. No jargon here,just curiosity.*

## The intuition

*Explain the concept in plain language. Use analogies. Imagine explaining this to a smart friend who hasn't studied stats. Aim for 3-5 paragraphs.*

## See it in action

*A plot, diagram, or visual that makes the concept click.*

```{r}
#| label: fig-main-visual
#| fig-cap: "Caption describing what the reader should notice"
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false

# Your R visualisation code here
```

## Why this matters for ML/AI

*Connect the concept back to machine learning or AI. 2-3 paragraphs.*

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Takeaway
*One sentence. If the reader remembers nothing else, they remember this.*
:::

## Coming next week

*Tease the next article.*
