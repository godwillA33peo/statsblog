The “mistakes” are measured using a loss function — which is a statistical concept. The way it finds the best split in a tree? Variance reduction — another statistical concept.\nLet’s see this with the simplest possible model — a straight line:\n\n\nCode\n# Generate some example data\nset.seed(42)\nn &lt;- 50\nsquare_metres &lt;- runif(n, 40, 200)\nprice &lt;- 50000 + 2500 * square_metres + rnorm(n, 0, 25000)\n\n# Fit the simplest model\nmodel &lt;- lm(price ~ square_metres)\n\n# Plot\nplot(square_metres, price / 1000,\n     pch = 19, col = \"#1a1a2e90\",\n     xlab = \"Size (square metres)\",\n     ylab = \"Price (€ thousands)\",\n     main = \"House Prices: One Line Explains a Lot\",\n     family = \"sans\", cex.main = 1.2)\nabline(model$coefficients[1] / 1000, model$coefficients[2] / 1000,\n       col = \"#e94560\", lwd = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A simple linear regression — the foundation beneath complex models\n\n\n\n\n\nThat red line?

My journey through operations research, public health program evaluation, and now Bayesian statistical modelling has taught me that the real power of data science lies not in knowing which algorithm to run, but in understanding why it works.\nI created Stats Beneath because I’ve seen too many talented engineers and data scientists skip over the statistical foundations that make machine learning actually work.

Our brains are terrible at probability — and that’s exactly why we need statistics.\n\n\n\nSurvivorship Bias\n\nDuring WWII, the military wanted to add armour to bomber planes. They studied returning planes and saw bullet holes clustered on the wings and fuselage. Mathematician Abraham Wald said: “Armour the places with NO holes.” The planes hit there never came back. This is survivorship bias — we only see the data that survived.\n\n\n\nSimpson’s Paradox\n\nA trend that appears in several groups of data can reverse when the groups are combined. UC Berkeley was once sued for gender discrimination in admissions. Overall, fewer women were admitted. But department by department, women were admitted at equal or higher rates. The “bias” was that women applied to more competitive departments.\n\n\n\nThe Monty Hall Problem\n\nYou’re on a game show with 3 doors. Behind one is a car. You pick door 1. The host opens door 3 (a goat). Should you switch? Yes — switching gives you a 2/3 chance of winning.

    "text": "A random variable is a question, not an answer\nHere’s the definition you’ll find everywhere: a random variable is a function that maps outcomes from a sample space to real numbers.\nThat’s technically correct and practically useless. Let me give you a better one.\nA random variable is a numerical quantity whose value hasn’t been determined yet.\nBefore you observe your data, you don’t know what values you’ll get. Will this patient’s blood pressure be 120 or 145? Will this customer churn or stay? Will this image contain a cat? You don’t know. But you know the kind of values that are possible, and you may have beliefs about which values are more likely.\nThat’s what a random variable captures: the space of possible values and their relative likelihoods, before you observe anything.\nOnce you observe a value — once the patient’s blood pressure reads 132 — that’s no longer a random variable. It’s a realisation. A data point. One draw from the underlying random process.\nYour entire dataset is a collection of realisations. Each row in your DataFrame was, before you observed it, a random variable. Now it’s a fixed number. But the process that generated it is still out there, and it could generate different numbers tomorrow.\nThis is why it matters: your model isn’t trying to memorise your specific 10,000 rows. It’s trying to learn the process that generated them, so it can make predictions about rows it hasn’t seen yet. You can’t do that without thinking about your data as draws from something larger.\n\nThe notation\nStatisticians use uppercase letters for random variables and lowercase for their observed values:\n\n\\(X\\) = the random variable (the question: “what will this patient’s blood pressure be?”)\n\\(x\\) = an observed value, a realisation (the answer: 132)\n\nWhen we write \\(X = x\\), we mean “the random variable \\(X\\) took the value \\(x\\).” When we write \\(P(X = x)\\), we mean “the probability that \\(X\\) takes the value \\(x\\).”\nThis isn’t pedantry. The distinction between \\(X\\) and \\(x\\) is the distinction between the process and the data. Confusing them is how you end up overfitting."

    "section": "Distributions: the shape of uncertainty",
    "text": "Distributions: the shape of uncertainty\nIf a random variable describes what could happen, a probability distribution describes how likely each possibility is.\nThink of it as a contract. Before you observe any data, the distribution tells you: “Here are all the possible values, and here’s the relative chance of each one.”\nThere are two flavours, depending on whether the random variable takes countable values or values on a continuum.\n\nDiscrete distributions: counting outcomes\nA discrete random variable takes values you can list: 0, 1, 2, 3, … or {cat, dog, bird}. The probability of each value is given by a probability mass function (PMF):\n\\[P(X = x) = p(x)\\]\nwith two rules: every probability is between 0 and 1, and they all add up to 1.\nThe Bernoulli distribution is the simplest possible distribution. A single trial. Two outcomes. Probability \\(p\\) of success, \\(1-p\\) of failure.\n\\[X \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p), \\quad P(X=1) = p, \\quad P(X=0) = 1-p\\]\nEvery binary classification target in your dataset follows a Bernoulli distribution. When your logistic regression outputs \\(\\hat{p} = 0.73\\), it’s estimating the parameter of a Bernoulli distribution. That’s literally what it’s doing — fitting \\(p\\).\nThe Binomial distribution counts the number of successes in \\(n\\) independent Bernoulli trials:\n\\[X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p), \\quad P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\\]\nIf you flip a coin 100 times, the number of heads is Binomial. If you classify 100 samples and count the correct ones, the number correct is Binomial (under independence). This is why your model’s accuracy has a sampling distribution — it’s not a fixed number, it’s a draw from a Binomial.\nThe Poisson distribution models the count of events in a fixed interval when events happen at a constant average rate:\n\\[X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda), \\quad P(X = k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\\]\nServer requests per minute. Customer complaints per day. Gene mutations per chromosome. Any time you’re modelling “how many times does something happen,” you’re probably looking at Poisson data.\n\n\nContinuous distributions: measuring on a continuum\nA continuous random variable takes values on the real line (or an interval). You can’t list all possible values, so you can’t assign a probability to any single value — \\(P(X = 1.23456789...) = 0\\) for any specific number.\nInstead, you describe probabilities over intervals using a probability density function (PDF):\n\\[P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx\\]\nThe PDF \\(f(x)\\) tells you how densely the probability is packed around each value. It’s not a probability itself — it can be greater than 1 — but the area under the curve over any interval gives you a probability.\nThe Normal (Gaussian) distribution is the one you know:\n\\[X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2), \\quad f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\]\nTwo parameters: \\(\\mu\\) (the centre) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) (the spread). It shows up everywhere, and there’s a deep reason for that — the Central Limit Theorem, which we’ll cover in a future article.\nBut here’s what matters for ML: when you assume your regression errors are normally distributed, you’re saying the residuals follow this specific shape. That’s not a trivial assumption. It determines your loss function (MSE corresponds to Gaussian errors), your confidence intervals, and your hypothesis tests. If the assumption is wrong, all of those break.\nThe Uniform distribution assigns equal probability to all values in an interval:\n\\[X \\sim \\text{Uniform}(a, b), \\quad f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\quad \\text{for } a \\leq x \\leq b\\]\nThis is the distribution of “I have no idea what value to expect.” When you initialise neural network weights uniformly, you’re sampling from this distribution. When you use random search for hyperparameter tuning, you’re drawing from it. It’s the mathematical formalisation of ignorance."

    "text": "The CDF: the cumulative view\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) gives the probability that \\(X\\) is less than or equal to a value:\n\\[F(x) = P(X \\leq x)\\]\nFor discrete random variables, the CDF is a step function. For continuous ones, it’s a smooth curve from 0 to 1. The CDF always exists, even when the PDF doesn’t (for discrete variables), which makes it the more fundamental object.\nWhy should you care? Because when you compute a percentile, a quantile, or a p-value, you’re using the CDF. When you say “this patient’s blood pressure is in the 95th percentile,” you’re saying \\(F(x) = 0.95\\)."

    "text": "The connection to ML you probably missed\nHere’s where everything clicks.\nEvery supervised learning problem is an attempt to learn a conditional distribution.\nWhen you fit a regression model, you’re estimating:\n\\[P(Y \\mid X) = \\text{some distribution parameterised by } X\\]\nFor linear regression with Gaussian errors, this is:\n\\[Y \\mid X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(X\\beta, \\sigma^2)\\]\nFor logistic regression:\n\\[Y \\mid X \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\sigma(X\\beta))\\]\nFor Poisson regression:\n\\[Y \\mid X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\exp(X\\beta))\\]\nIn each case, \\(X\\) (the features) determine the parameters of the distribution, and \\(Y\\) (the target) is a random draw from that distribution. The model doesn’t predict \\(Y\\) directly — it predicts the distribution of \\(Y\\), and the point prediction is just a summary (usually the mean).\nThis is why understanding distributions isn’t optional for ML. You’re fitting them whether you know it or not. sklearn just hides it from you.\n\nThe loss function is the distribution\nThis connection goes even deeper. Your choice of loss function implicitly assumes a distribution:\n\n\n\nLoss Function\nImplicit Distribution\nLink\n\n\n\n\nMean Squared Error\nNormal (Gaussian)\nIdentity\n\n\nCross-Entropy\nBernoulli / Categorical\nLogit / Softmax\n\n\nPoisson Deviance\nPoisson\nLog\n\n\nHuber Loss\nA compromise: Normal near 0, Laplace in the tails\n—\n\n\n\nWhen you minimise MSE, you’re doing maximum likelihood estimation under the assumption that your errors are Gaussian. When you minimise cross-entropy, you’re doing MLE under the assumption that your targets are Bernoulli.\nIf you’ve ever wondered “why MSE for regression and cross-entropy for classification?” — this is the answer. It’s not arbitrary. Each loss function is derived from a distributional assumption about the target variable. We’ll make this precise when we cover likelihood in a future article."

    "text": "What this means in practice\nUnderstanding random variables and distributions gives you three practical superpowers:\n1. You can diagnose model failures. If your regression residuals aren’t approximately normal, MSE might not be the right loss. If your count data has more zeros than Poisson allows, you need a zero-inflated model. If your binary classifier’s predicted probabilities don’t match observed frequencies, it’s miscalibrated. All of these diagnoses require understanding the distributional assumptions you’ve made.\n2. You can quantify uncertainty. A prediction of \\(\\hat{y} = 42\\) is useless without knowing how confident you are. If you know the distribution, you can compute prediction intervals, confidence intervals, and posterior distributions. Without it, you’re flying blind.\n3. You can choose the right model. Gaussian targets → linear regression (or ridge, lasso). Binary targets → logistic regression. Count targets → Poisson regression. Skewed positive targets → Gamma regression. Bounded proportions → Beta regression. The distribution of your target variable tells you which model family to use."

I’ll fit a model to it.”\nAfter: “My data is a sample of realisations from an unknown data-generating process. My model is a hypothesis about what that process looks like. Training is estimating the parameters of that process. Evaluation is checking whether my hypothesis is consistent with new realisations.”\nThat second framing is what statistics gives you. It’s more precise, more honest, and it leads to better models.\nNext week, we’ll build on this foundation. You now know that your data comes from distributions and your models estimate distributions. But what exactly are you estimating when you compute a mean, a variance, or a loss? That’s the world of expected values — and it turns out your loss function is one.\n\nThis is article 2 of Stats Beneath, a weekly series on the statistical foundations of machine learning.
