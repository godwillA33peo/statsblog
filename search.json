Our brains are terrible at probability — and that’s exactly why we need statistics.\n\n\n\nSurvivorship Bias\n\nDuring WWII, the military wanted to add armour to bomber planes. They studied returning planes and saw bullet holes clustered on the wings and fuselage. Mathematician Abraham Wald said: “Armour the places with NO holes.” The planes hit there never came back. This is survivorship bias — we only see the data that survived.\n\n\n\nSimpson’s Paradox\n\nA trend that appears in several groups of data can reverse when the groups are combined. UC Berkeley was once sued for gender discrimination in admissions. Overall, fewer women were admitted. But department by department, women were admitted at equal or higher rates. The “bias” was that women applied to more competitive departments.\n\n\n\nThe Monty Hall Problem\n\nYou’re on a game show with 3 doors. Behind one is a car. You pick door 1. The host opens door 3 (a goat). Should you switch? Yes — switching gives you a 2/3 chance of winning. Even Paul Erdős, one of the greatest mathematicians ever, refused to believe this until he saw a computer simulation."

Data visualisation literally saved lives.\n\n\n\nThe Term “Data Scientist”\n\nThe term “data scientist” was coined in 2008 by DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher, who were building data teams at LinkedIn and Facebook.

The “mistakes” are measured using a loss function — which is a statistical concept. The way it finds the best split in a tree? Variance reduction — another statistical concept.\nLet’s see this with the simplest possible model — a straight line:\n\n\nCode\n# Generate some example data\nset.seed(42)\nn &lt;- 50\nsquare_metres &lt;- runif(n, 40, 200)\nprice &lt;- 50000 + 2500 * square_metres + rnorm(n, 0, 25000)\n\n# Fit the simplest model\nmodel &lt;- lm(price ~ square_metres)\n\n# Plot\nplot(square_metres, price / 1000,\n     pch = 19, col = \"#1a1a2e90\",\n     xlab = \"Size (square metres)\",\n     ylab = \"Price (€ thousands)\",\n     main = \"House Prices: One Line Explains a Lot\",\n     family = \"sans\", cex.main = 1.2)\nabline(model$coefficients[1] / 1000, model$coefficients[2] / 1000,\n       col = \"#e94560\", lwd = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A simple linear regression — the foundation beneath complex models\n\n\n\n\n\nThat red line?
